# 1.0 Fake ID Generator
This repository is designed to allow a python3 script to generate a randomized fake IDs, producing identification details that closely mimic real-world ID formats.
The generated IDs are entirely fictitious and do not contain any real or personal information.
This tool is invaluable for **developers**, **testers**, and **data scientists** who need realistic yet fake data for applications, testing environments, or simulations. It is particularly useful for generating mock data in situations where real user information is either unsuitable or unavailable, maintaining privacy and anonymity in the process.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This script generates random first names, last names, addresses, and other personal details, based on common formats used in the United States.

## 1.1 Feature Overview
- **Random Name Generation**:  
  The script can generate a fake full name using a list of random first and last names.
- **Random Date of Birth (DOB)**:  
  It generates a plausible birthdate within a specified range, ensuring the age group or required age is realistic.
- **Fake Address**:  
  The script can produce a fake address, including street name, city, state, and ZIP code, using predefined lists to resemble an address on a real ID.
- **Fake Identification Number**:  
  A random but realistic ID number (e.g., driver's license number) is generated. The number may follow typical patterns for official documents, such as U.S. driver's licenses.
- **Additional Customizable Details**:  
  It can generate other personal details like gender, height, weight, and eye color.

>[!WARNING]
>## Warning & Disclaimer:
>**This script is intended solely for educational purposes or legitimate testing scenarios.** The creation of fake IDs for fraudulent, deceptive, or illegal activities is both unethical and illegal. The generated data is for use in controlled environments only and should not be used for unlawful purposes.
